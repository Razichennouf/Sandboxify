Sandbox Processes With Systemd

Step 0: This package provides a simple way to enable basic seccomp system call filtering in any application (even proprietary one) via environment variables. It is very similar to
Step 1: Network Segmentation

Configure the virtual machine to use a separate network segment.

Step 2: Use a VPN

Establish a VPN connection from the virtual machine to a trusted network or service.

Step 3: Network Monitoring

Install and use the Wireshark network monitoring tool.

Step 4: Host-Based Firewall

Enable and configure the host-based firewall within the virtual machine.

Step 5: Filesystem Isolation

Create a separate directory for storing experiment-related files.

Step 6: User Privileges

Create a non-administrative user account and switch to that user.

Step 7: Virtual Machine Snapshots

Take a snapshot of the virtual machine's current state.

Step 8: Disable Shared Folders

Disable shared folders between the host machine and virtual machine.

Step 9: Monitoring and Analysis

Monitor system logs and network traffic using appropriate tools.

Step 10: Post-Experiment Cleanup
